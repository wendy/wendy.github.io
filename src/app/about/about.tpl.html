    <h2 class="title aboutTitle">ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p class="aboutParagraph">
      Quarter-life crisis is the new mid-life, and hitting 25 has made me more aware of it than ever. Don’t get me wrong, college has been an amazing experience, but it didn’t lead me to the path that I was looking for. 
    </p><p class="aboutParagraph">
      One year ago as luck will have it, I stumbled upon learning about coding bootcamps. I have always had an interest in technology and programming, so in the midst of self-discovery with nothing to lose, I packed my bags, moved from one big city to another (NY - SF), and enrolled at Hack Reactor. 
    </p><p class="aboutParagraph">
      Subsequent to graduating the program, Hack Reactor hired me to stay on for a few months assisting the new incoming students. It has been an invigorating experience to see where I was, how far I’ve come, to eventually helping others achieve the same. I love being a part of that community but now I’m ready for my next adventure.   
    </p><p class="aboutParagraph">
      I am a full-stack software engineer with a focus in javascript. I have experience with frameworks such as backbone, angular, and react. I also have backend experience with node.js/express. If you have a job opportunity/lead to my next expedition, let’s grab coffee or boba!
